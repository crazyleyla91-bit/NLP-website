  <!-- ABOUT -->

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am an NLP consultant working with individuals and organizations
      who value clarity, responsibility, and practical development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work combines NLP methodologies with coaching principles and
      real-world professional experience. I focus on helping clients
      understand their own thinking and communication patterns, so change
      becomes sustainable rather than forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe effective development is structured, respectful, and
      grounded in real application, not exaggerated promises.
